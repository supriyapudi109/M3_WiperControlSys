A windscreen wiper is a device used to wipe moisture and dirt from the windscreen. 
Theearly wipers invented is operated manually by moving a lever inside the car back and forth.The wipers faithfully keep the windscreen clear,
 moving back and forth across thewindscreen countless time as they sweep the moisture away
 The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade,
 a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.
 REQUIRMENTS:
 STM32CUBEIDE
 CYGWIN
 QEMU
 
 COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT:
  STM32F407G-DISC1
STM32F407 series of microcontrollers are high-performance MCUs designed for medical, industrial and consumer applications. 
It is based on ARM Cortex-M4 and offers up to 168MHz. The STM32F407VGT6 is the onboard chip which comes in a 100-pin LQFP package.

here in STM we have limited components, so we work with a basic logic like:
Long press -On 
1st Click - speed 1 
2nd Click- speed 2
3rd Click- speed 3
Long press - off

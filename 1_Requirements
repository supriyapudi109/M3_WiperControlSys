REQUIRMENTS:
 STM32CUBEIDE
 CYGWIN
 QEMU
 
 COMPONENTS USED IN PROJECT:
  STM32F407G-DISC1
STM32F407 series of microcontrollers are high-performance MCUs designed for medical, industrial and consumer applications. 
It is based on ARM Cortex-M4 and offers up to 168MHz. The STM32F407VGT6 is the onboard chip which comes in a 100-pin LQFP package.

here in STM we have limited components, so we work with a basic logic like:
Long press -On 
1st Click - speed 1 
2nd Click- speed 2
3rd Click- speed 3
Long press - off

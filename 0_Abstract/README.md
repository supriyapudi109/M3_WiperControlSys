A windscreen wiper is a device used to wipe moisture and dirt from the windscreen. 
Theearly wipers invented is operated manually by moving a lever inside the car back and forth.The wipers faithfully keep the windscreen clear,
 moving back and forth across thewindscreen countless time as they sweep the moisture away
 The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper arm holding the blade,
 a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper.
 OBJECTIVE
The aim of the project is to design a wiper control system which automatically controls the wiper according to the rain fall of water.In large cities and industries where supply and distribution tanks are at a largedistance from water control station, it is very difficult situation to monitor the water.

The main objective of this project is through ARM microcontroller to design a wiper control system. The project mainly insists on controlling the motion of wiper based on frequency and time period (in seconds).
